# odin-recipes
Test website for The Odin Project

A project to summarise all my accumulated knowledge so far and a reminder to how far I've come in the future.

I'll be looking at creating a basic website in html using a sensibile folder structure. Bold text, italics, unorganised and organised lists and images will populate the document itself. I will attempt to use proper commit message etiqutte and ensure my messages are clear and concise.

Here's to the future!
